## Routing Structure

The application uses React Router for navigation with the following route structure:

- `/` - Home page with list of all courses
- `/courses/:courseFolder` - Course details page with list of units
- `/courses/:courseFolder/units/:unitFolder` - Unit details page with list of subunits
- `/courses/:courseFolder/units/:unitFolder/subunits/:subunitFile` - Subunit content page

## Component Hierarchy

- `Layout`: Wraps the entire application with header and footer
  - `Header`: App header with navigation
  - `Outlet`: Renders the current route's component
    - `CoursesPage`: Displays list of courses
    - `CourseDetailsPage`: Displays course details and units
    - `UnitDetailsPage`: Displays unit details and subunits
    - `SubunitContentPage`: Displays subunit content
  - `Footer`: App footer
- `Breadcrumbs`: Provides hierarchical navigation across the app
